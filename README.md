## Info

The app uses rust-tui as a rendering framework and a discogs api to fetch the records from the web. The records are then saved to a local file in an easy to read (and modify) json format. 

## Running the app

To run the app
```
cargo run
```
As the app is written in rust it can be very easily compiled to a binary.

## Development info
This is my first project written in rust so it ain't nothing fancy. Changes, if any, won't come in regularly.
